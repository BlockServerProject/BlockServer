BlockServer Contributing Guidelines
===
## Contributing code
Please fork the repo and [create a pull request](https://github.com/BlockServerProject/BlockServer/pulls). Please note the following before you start writing code:
* The code should follow the format at [Syntax.md](Syntax.md).
* The docs should follow the format at [Docs.md](Docs.md).
* If you are adding new features, please make sure we want it in our repo currently. If you find it [here](https://github.com/BlockServerProject/BlockServer/issues/112), you can start working on it (if nobody else is assigned for that task).

## Creating issues
Issues must only be issues, not questions or support request. Please contact us on [IRC channel #blockserverproject](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/?nick=bsguest|?#blockserverproject) if you are having trouble setting up the server.

If you are facing an issue that nobody else is facing, you are most likely doing wrong. Contact us on [IRC channel #blockserverproject](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/?nick=bsguest|?#blockserverproject) for support.

Please provide enough information for us to debug. We would like to know how that bug happened and your system information. Please mention them in the issue.
